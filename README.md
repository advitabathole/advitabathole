# Hi, I'm Advita!
I'm a first-year **Artificial Intelligence Engineering** student at **UC San Diego**, exploring the intersection of machine learning, programming, and applied science. I love building things from the ground up — whether it's ML models, automation tools, or small software projects that help me learn.

Currently working at the **IDEA Engineering Center at UCSD**, where I support engineering student programs and professional development.

## Highlight Projects (in progress)
I’m building a set of projects to strengthen my AI engineering foundations:

- **CIFAR-10 Image Classifier** (Python, PyTorch)  
- **Sentiment Classifier (NLP)** using classical + neural approaches  
- **AI Demo App** using Streamlit + an ML model  
- **DSA Practice Repo** (Java/Python)

(Once these are created, I’ll pin them below.)
